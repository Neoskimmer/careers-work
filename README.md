# STEM Career Options

### The heading should be self explanatory, but if it's not, here's the rundown:

This repo contains some career paths for those who are interested.
These careers are accessible to anyone with the required qualifications, and are probably suitable for interns aswell. STEM Careers can be applied to many different areas, don't think these are the only options! Try researching some more options :D

## (Ethical) Hackers

Hacking doesn't have to be bad, it can be ethical too! Click [here](https://github.com/Neoskimmer/careers-work/blob/main/white-hat-hacking.md) to learn more about how hackers can do good in the world :D

## Healthcare

Due to the revolution in technology, we can use it to our advantage to support hospitals and doctors. Click [here](https://github.com/Neoskimmer/careers-work/blob/main/robots%20and%20software%20in%20healthcare.md) to find out how you can help :D

## Roboticist

When you think of robots, you probably think of big machines that drill holes 24 hours a day, 7 days a week or scary robots that resemble humans. But robots are so much more, from your washing machine to your toaster! Click [here](https://github.com/Neoskimmer/careers-work/blob/main/robot-designer.md) to learn more about what else robots can do for you and the world! :D

# But what if I just want a "fun" job?

That's fine too! There are plenty of people who do STEM as their job but still have fun.
Here are some examples:

### [Simone Giertz](https://www.youtube.com/@simonegiertz) 

Simone runs a YouTube channel, where she invents silly, wacky and genuinely useful things such as the [Truckla: World's first Tesla Pickup-truck.](https://youtu.be/R35gWBtLCYg?si=WlU896mdkG8A5trh)

I also recommend checking out her [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0bsKc4tiuY) titled "Why you should make useless things"

### [Michael Reeves](https://www.youtube.com/@MichaelReeves)

Michael Reeves also runs a YouTube channel, where he creates extremely silly solutions to real world problems. A great example is when he made a [robot to take tomatoes out of his salad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2gq4IwIc_s).

### FIRST Robotics mentor

FIRST Robotics is a global robotics program that runs 5 competitions all over the world. As a mentor, you teach kids to create robots and solve technical problems while encouraging teamwork.
