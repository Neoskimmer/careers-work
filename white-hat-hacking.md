## What are White Hat Hackers?

The term 'hacker' can mean a lot of things, but many people think of this when some one says hacker:

But White Hat Hackers are much different. See, these hackers hack things for good. Here's what a White Hat Hacker does:

1. The hacker finds a bug in something that a large company made. These bugs are usually called Zero Day Exploits.
2. The hacker finds a way to use this for something bad.
3. They tell the large company about their findings, and _usually_, but not always, the company will pay that hacker.
4. Repeat!

Here's another way a White Hat Hacker can earn money:

1. A large company like Google or Microsoft will host a competition to see who can hack something the company made in the fastest way possible.
2. The hacker wins the competition and earns some kind of prize. The prize can either be a cash prize or a job spot at the company.

The second way is a lot less comment for a couple reasons. 

One reason is that these competitions aren't hosted that frequently, and it can use a lot of the hacker's time and energy, only to end up not winning.

The first way is much better, since not only does it help the company and everyone who uses those products, it also gives unethical hackers an incentive to use their skills for good.

Thanks for reading :D
